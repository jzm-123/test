The system receives an event, over a network, from a first on-line transaction processing platform. The event includes a first identity identifier that identifies a first identity and information that identifies a first activity performed by the first identity. The system generates reporting information based on the event. The reporting information includes a first score that is associated with the first identity. The first score is a measure of a likelihood that the first identity has performed a fraudulent activity. Finally, the system communicates the first score, over the network, to the first on-line transaction processing platform. The system communicates the first score in response to receiving the event."}, {"title": "GRAPH PATTERN RECOGNITION INTERFACE", "issuer": "us", "issueDate": "2009-6-4"}, {"title": "Skill Ranking System", "issuer": "us", "filingDate": "2012-1-24", "applicationNumber": "13/357,302"}, {"title": "Skill Customization System", "issuer": "us", "filingDate": "2012-1-24", "applicationNumber": "13/357,360"}, {"title": "Skill Extraction System", "issuer": "us", "filingDate": "2012-1-24", "applicationNumber": "13/357,171"}, {"title": "Transaction data representations using an adjacency matrix", "issuer": "us", "filingDate": "2009-5-14", "applicationNumber": "20090125543"}, {"title": "Methods and systems for exploring career options", "issuer": "us"}]
